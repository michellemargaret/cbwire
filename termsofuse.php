will not be sold, rented, printed, published or otherwise made available to third parties.
<br><br>
When entering listings under Things To Do, Classifieds, Attractions or Directory, the nature of this listing requires

information is used for statistical information purposes to ensure CB Wire continues to meet the needs of its users.
<br><br>
The policy applies solely to pages directly within the CB Wire website.  This website provides links to other websites that 
have no affiliation with CB Wire.  We are in no way responsible for any information entered on or for the handling of any information 
provided by you to third party websites.

<br><br>
This privacy policy describes how the CB Wire website, tools, applcations, and services (*CB Wire*) 
handle your personal information. CB Wire collects and uses personal information to enable CB Wire
 to function and to keep CB Wire safe (details below). 
 <br><br>
Collection. Information posted on CB Wire is publicly available. Our servers are located 
in the United States, Canada, European Union and elsewhere in the world. Therefore, if you choose to 
provide us with personal information, you are consenting to CB Wire's collection, use, disclosure 
of your personal information and to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers in 
the United States, Canada, the European Union, and elsewhere in the world. CB Wire may collect and 
store the following personal information: 
email address, phone numbers, physical contact information, 
computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from CB Wire and ad data, 
other information, including users IP address and standard web log information. 
Use. CB Wire uses users' personal information to:
provide our services; 
customize, measure, and improve user experience and our services, content, and advertising; 
do other things for users as described when CB Wire collects the information. 
<br><br>
Disclosure. CB Wire doesn't sell or rent users' personal information to third parties. CB Wire may 
disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, or protect anyone's rights, property, 
or safety. CB Wire may also share personal information with:
corporate affiliates who help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts. 
service providers who help with our business operations. 
<br><br>
Access, Modification, and Deletion. You can see, modify or erase most of your personal

 information when CB Wire no longer needs it for the purposes we described earlier. 
 CB Wire retains personal information as permitted by law to resolve disputes, 
 enforce our policies; and prevent bad guys from coming back. 
 <br><br>

Security. CB Wire uses lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security) to protect your 
personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, but as you probably know, 
nothing's perfect, so CB Wire makes no guarantees.
<br><br>
Cookies. CB Wire or our service providers may use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive)
 on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and 
 advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A few important 
 things you should know about cookies are that:
